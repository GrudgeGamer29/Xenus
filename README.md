# Xenus
A discord bot programmed in the Java language using JDA.

> This bot has been decommissioned thus the project is no longer maintained.
So I decided to make this project open sourced so that people can use the code.

## Setup the config

You can change the key values of either 
[`development.yml`](https://github.com/Vortek-Academy/Xenus/blob/master/src/main/resources/development.yml) or 
[`production.yml`](https://github.com/Vortek-Academy/Xenus/blob/master/src/main/resources/production.yml) based on your 
environment.

You also need to change the [`.env`](https://github.com/ThatAnonymousG/Xenus/blob/master/src/main/resources/.env) to 
use the correct config. You can either set the ENV to `development` or `production`.
